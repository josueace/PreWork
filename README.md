## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The main challenge I experienced in this experiment was the push to the github repository. I did not realize github had terminated the username and password authentication in 2021. Now you have to access it only using a PAT(Personal Access Token). The learning of the github PAT was challenging but nonetheless valuable.
